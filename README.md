# bch-token-sweep

This is a library that allows sweeping of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Simple Ledger Protocol (SLP) tokens from a paper wallet. Paper wallets are just a WIF private key embedded inside a QR code. You can generate a paper wallet for BCH at [paperwallet.bitcoin.com](https://paperwallet.bitcoin.com) and SLP tokens at [slp-paper-wallet.fullstack.cash](https://slp-paper-wallet.fullstack.cash/).

This library is intended to be used by the [gatsby-plugin-bch-sweep](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/gatsby-plugin-bch-sweep) Gatsby Plugin. This is a plugin that is incorporated into the [wallet.fullstack.cash](https://wallet.fullstack.cash) web wallet.
